How does it work?
Image tells it pretty much: the shaker is divided in two parts, for salt and pepper. 

Unique features, mechanisms:
- Buttons for covers
- Two in one -shaker
	Those parts are connected with spiral

This design was based on:

22. Change surface properties
30. Divide continuous surface
11. Allow user to re-orient
20. Change geometry

How is this different from original concept:
- Button
- It has two shakers in the same, and those can be detached

How is this similar to original concept:
- Quite a traditional shape/form and basic functionality.
